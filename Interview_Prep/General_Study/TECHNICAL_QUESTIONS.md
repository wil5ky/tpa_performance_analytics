# STRATEGIC QUESTIONS TO ASK THE INTERVIEWER

*Ask these to sound like a Senior Peer/Consultant, not just a candidate.*

## 1. THE "DATA STATE" QUESTION
"I saw the focus on 'Claims Mart' and TPA data flows. I'm curious—is the primary challenge right now getting the data **IN** (ingestion/cleaning from disparate TPAs), or getting the insights **OUT** (reporting/visualization for leadership)?"
*   *Why ask:* Shows you care about the bottleneck.
*   *Follow-up:* "That makes sense. In my last project, we spent 80% of our effort on the ingestion/cleaning side so that the reporting side became push-button easy."

## 2. THE "MATURITY" QUESTION
"Where is the team currently on the spectrum between Excel/Manual Reporting and Automated/Database-driven reporting? Are you looking for someone to maintain existing processes, or really drive a migration to more modern tools?"
*   *Why ask:* Helps you frame your Python/SQL skills. If they are all Excel, you are the "Efficiency Expert." If they are modernizing, you are the "Architect."

## 3. THE "IMPACT" QUESTION
"You mentioned 'Actuarial Impact.' Can you give an example of a time when a TPA data quality issue bubbled up to affect a strategic decision? I want to understand the stakes of the data governance you need."
*   *Why ask:* Shows you understand the *business consequence* of your work, not just the technical task.

## 4. THE "SUCCESS" QUESTION
"Six months from now, if I've been successful in this role, what is the one specific headache or manual process that would be gone from your plate?"
*   *Why ask:* Gets them visualizing you solving their problem.
