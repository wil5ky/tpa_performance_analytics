# INTERVIEW CHEAT SHEET: Zurich TPA Operations Sr. Performance Analyst

## 🚀 ELEVATOR PITCH (The "Innovator within the Industry" Answer)
*Goal: Position RE-DEALS as your superpower, built on a foundation of solid industry experience.*

"I’m a Treasury Analyst at **Liberty Mutual** by day, but what really differentiates me is that I am also a **developer** who builds institutional-grade financial software.

My foundation is in Insurance and Finance—at Liberty and Apex, I’ve managed liquidity for Fortune 100 insurers and modeled risk for \$10B portfolios. I know the stakes.

But my **key differentiator** is exemplified by my independent project, **RE-DEALS**:
I built a complete Commercial Real Estate analysis system from scratch—writing 600+ lines of Python, designing a 19-table SQL database, and creating a 'forensic validation' engine.
This system automated a 6-hour manual analysis into a **5-minute process** and caught **\$5.7M** in valuation errors that human analysts missed.

I want to bring that same **RE-DEALS level of technical innovation**—the Python automation, the database architecture, the forensic data validation—to Zurich’s TPA Operations, backing it with the industry safety and compliance knowledge I have from Liberty."

## ⚠️ TRAPS TO AVOID
*   **Trap:** Letting them think RE-DEALS is just a "hobby."
*   **Fix:** Always refer to it as "My independent development project" or "A production-grade system I architected." Focus on the **complexity** (SQL, Python, 4-Agent Validation) to show it's professional work.
