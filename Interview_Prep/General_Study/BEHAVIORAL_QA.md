# BEHAVIORAL Q&A: RE-DEALS as the Star

## STAR STORIES (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

### 1. "TELL ME ABOUT A TIME YOU INNOVATED / IMPROVED A PROCESS."
**Use the RE-DEALS Story. This is your Home Run.**

*   **Situation:** In the commercial real estate space, the industry standard was manual Excel analysis. It was slow (4-6 hours/deal) and prone to human error.
*   **Action:** I didn't just improve the Excel sheet; **I architected a software solution.** I built a Python engine to automate the financial math (IRR/Waterfalls) and a SQL database to enforce data integrity. I built a "Forensic Validator" that automatically cross-referenced broker claims against external market APIs.
*   **Result:** I reduced the workflow to **<5 minutes (94% faster)**. But more importantly, the system's logic caught a **\$5.7M overvaluation** that manual analysis missed.
*   **Zurich Connect:** "I see the same opportunity in TPA data flows. We can move from 'manual checking' to 'automated validation engines'."

### 2. "DESCRIBE A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE YOU OVERCAME."
**Use the RE-DEALS Story. Show off the Coding.**

*   **Situation:** I needed to solve for the "Maximum Allowable Cost" of a property, but it was constrained by three different variables: Cash-on-Cash return, Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), and a Cap-Rate margin.
*   **Action:** I wrote a Python script using the Newton-Raphson method to reverse-engineer the purchase price. I had to handle convergence errors and edge cases where the financing terms wouldn't pencil out.
*   **Result:** This tool gave us a scientific "Walk Away Price" for negotiations. We used this data to negotiate a **17% price reduction** on a deal.
*   **Zurich Connect:** "I bring this level of complex modeling rigor to your profitability reports."

### 3. "HOW DO YOU HANDLE DATA GOVERNANCE / QUALITY?"
**Use the Liberty Mutual Story. Show you are 'Safe'.**

*   **Situation:** Innovation is great, but governance is requisite. At Liberty, I own the monitoring for the Corporate Card program.
*   **Action:** I implemented a monitoring suite in Power BI that acts as a gatekeeper. It audits transactions against policy rules before they are booked.
*   **Result:** This ensures that the data entering our financial systems is clean.
*   **Synthesis:** "So while my RE-DEALS project shows I can *build* the innovative tools, my time at Liberty proves I know how to *operate* them within a strict corporate governance framework."

### 4. "TELL ME ABOUT MANAGING RISK."
**Use the Apex Fintech Story. Show Scale.**

*   **Situation:** Managing an **\$8-10B portfolio** of deposits at Apex.
*   **Action:** The risk wasn't just "bad data"—it was interest rate variability. I built models to forecast Net Interest Income (NII) under different Fed rate scenarios.
*   **Result:** These forecasts guided strategic asset allocation. I understand that for Zurich, "Data Quality" isn't just about neat rows in Excel; it's about whether the Actuarial models downstream are pricing risk correctly.
