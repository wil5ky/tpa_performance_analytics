## 1. Core KPIs for TPA Claims Performance

### Efficiency & Speed
- **Claims Turnaround Time (Claim Cycle Time)**: Industry benchmark: 22-24 days for property/auto claims
  - *Your Position:* "I focus on reducing cycle time through automated validation gates and proactive data flow monitoring"
  
- **Processing Accuracy**: Paying claims correctly the first time
  - *Your Position:* "I've reduced errors by 83% through systematic validation frameworks"
  
- **Claims Processed Per Adjuster**: Operational efficiency metric
  - *Your Position:* "I've saved 360+ hours annually, which directly translates to higher throughput per FTE"

### Financial Performance
- **Average Cost Per Claim**: Cost management effectiveness
- **Loss Ratio**: Total incurred losses ÷ total earned premiums (profitability indicator)
- **Average Savings**: Demonstrating cost containment vs. benchmarks
  - *Your Position:* "My forensic validation work prevented $5.7M in potential losses—that's the kind of savings governance can deliver"

### Quality & Governance
- **Reserve Accuracy**: Monitoring for under-reserved claims
- **Data Quality Score**: Percentage of claims with complete, accurate data
  - *Your Position:* "I don't just monitor accuracy; I own the end-to-end data flow"

## 2. Best Practices in TPA Performance Reporting

### Establish Clear Metrics & Benchmarks
- **Industry Standard:** Monitor TPA performance against industry benchmarks and peer comparisons
- **Your Approach:** "I establish KPIs upfront and build dashboards that auto-flag when we fall below benchmark"

### Performance Guarantees in Contracts
- **Industry Standard:** TPA contracts include SLAs for turnaround times, accuracy, and responsiveness
- **Your Approach:** "I create the monitoring infrastructure that *proves* whether SLAs are met"

### Transparency & Data Access
- **Industry Standard:** Clients need real-time access to claims processing systems or detailed status reports
- **Your Approach:** "I build 'single source of truth' dashboards so stakeholders don't have to ask—they can see it"

### Leverage Technology
- **Claims Management Software:** Streamlines administration
- **Advanced Analytics:** Trend analysis, root cause investigation, fraud detection
- **Automation:** Frees adjusters from repetitive tasks
  - *Your Position:* "I use SQL, Python, and Power BI to build automated ETL pipelines and monitoring suites—exactly what modern TPA performance systems need"

### Risk Management & Fraud Detection
- **Industry Standard:** AI-driven anomaly detection, pattern recognition
- **Your Approach:** "I've explored anomaly detection in Python with Internal Audit—proactive risk management, not reactive"

## 3. 2024-2025 Industry Trends

### AI Integration
- **Trend:** AI for automated claims triage, fraud detection, and customer service chatbots
- **Your Position:** "I use AI to accelerate analysis—triage, pattern-finding—but I validate everything through SQL and Python checks to maintain data integrity"

### Enhanced Data Governance
- **Trend:** Regulatory scrutiny around AI bias, data privacy (GDPR/CCPA), and transparency
- **Your Position:** "I built a governance framework with 'stop/continue' gates—bad data doesn't flow downstream"

### Predictive Analytics
- **Trend:** Shifting from reactive reporting to predictive risk assessment
- **Your Position:** "I forecast NII and model rate impacts—I'm already thinking predictively"

### Integrated Reporting (ESG + Financial)
- **Trend:** Combining financial and ESG data for holistic performance reporting
- **Your Position:** "I understand the shift to integrated reporting—my dashboards already combine operational, financial, and compliance metrics"

### IFRS 17 Compliance (2024)
- **Trend:** New accounting standard requiring more detailed disclosures for insurance contracts
- **Your Position:** "I'm familiar with evolving reporting standards and build systems that adapt to regulatory changes"

### Cybersecurity & Incident Reporting
- **Trend:** 24-hour reporting requirements for cyberattacks (ISG/CSV frameworks)
- **Your Position:** "I understand the importance of real-time monitoring—my systems are built for speed and transparency"

## 4. Claims Data Marts Architecture

### What is a Claims Data Mart?
- **Definition:** A specialized data repository that centralizes claims information from disparate sources (policy admin, claim systems, CRM, financial systems)
- **Purpose:** Enable efficient querying, OLAP, and data mining for business intelligence

### How You've Done This
- *Your Position:* "While I haven't worked on a system literally called 'Claims Mart,' I've built the exact same thing—downstream data flow from enterprise systems into a centralized reporting layer with validation checkpoints. That's what Claims Mart is."

### Key Components
1. **Source Systems Integration:** ETL from multiple systems
2. **Data Quality Validation:** Automated checks before data enters the mart
3. **Performance Optimization:** Fact/dimension tables for fast queries
4. **Self-Service Analytics:** Power BI semantic models for stakeholder access

## 5. Positioning Strategy for William Schwartz Interview

### When Asked About TPA Experience
> "I don't have a job title that says 'TPA,' but I've done the two hardest parts of TPA performance analytics:
> 1. **Owning downstream data quality** through Claims Mart-style data flows
> 2. **Turning that data into profitability insights** that executives use to make strategic decisions
> 
> At Liberty Mutual, I managed operational data flows across enterprise systems, built governance frameworks, and delivered performance reporting at scale—exactly what this role does for TPA operations."

### When Asked About Claims Background
> "My claims experience is indirect but highly relevant: I monitor operational performance for 20,000+ users, which involves understanding **transaction flows**, **error patterns**, and **risk indicators**—the same analytical muscle you need for TPA claims performance. The tools (SQL, Power BI) and the mindset (data quality → governance → insight) are identical."

### When Asked "What Makes You Best-in-Class?"
> "Three things:
> 1. **Data Lineage Ownership:** I don't just report numbers; I own the pipe that delivers them
> 2. **AI + Governance Hybrid:** I use AI to move fast, but validation gates to stay accurate
> 3. **Executive-Ready Output:** My dashboards answer the question *before* leadership asks it"

## 6. Industry Vocabulary to Use

Use these terms naturally in conversation:
- **Claims Cycle Time** (instead of just "turnaround time")
- **Loss Ratio** and **Reserve Accuracy**
- **Data Mart** and **OLAP**
- **Fraud Detection via Anomaly Analytics**
- **SLA Monitoring** and **Performance Guarantees**
- **Root Cause Analysis** and **Trend Investigation**
- **IFRS 17** (if discussing financial reporting)
- **Predictive vs. Reactive Analytics**
