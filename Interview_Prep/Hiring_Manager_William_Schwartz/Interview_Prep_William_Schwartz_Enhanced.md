## 🎯 Strategic Positioning
**Your "Hook" for William:**
You are not just an analyst who runs reports; you are an **owner of data governance and process**. William needs someone who can "turn complex datasets into actionable insights" and "own downstream data flow." Your angle is:
> "I build the governance and validation frameworks that *make* the data trustworthy, so leadership can make decisions without second-guessing the numbers."

## 1. Motivational Fit
*Evaluates: Why Zurich? Why this role? Alignment with culture.*

### Q: What is it that attracts you most to a role or career at Zurich?
**Key Talking Point / Script:**
> "Zurich has the scale and reputation of a global leader, but what draws me most is the specific maturity level of your operations. You’re at a point where you value **governance and systematic financial scrutiny**—which is exactly where I thrive. I want to work in an environment where 'getting the numbers right' is seen as a strategic advantage, not just back-office compliance."

**STAR Response (Evidence):**
*   **Situation:** I’ve spent the last 3 years at Liberty Mutual refining Treasury operations, helping to transform it into a "Value Center".
*   **Task:** I am looking for a role that prioritizes **operational excellence** and **systematic financial scrutiny** on a global scale.
*   **Action:** Zurich’s commitment to "Technical Excellence" matches my recent focus on building rigorous governance frameworks (like the ERS receipt digitization I led).
*   **Result:** I see Zurich as the place where I can apply my "continuous improvement" mindset (evidenced by my 96% SLA rates) to a larger, more complex risk landscape.

### Q: What is it that most interests you about this role?
**Key Talking Point / Script:**
> "It’s the intersection of **performance reporting** and **data ownership**. In many roles, you just report what you're given. This role explicitly mentions 'owning downstream data flow' and 'resolving data flow issues.' I enjoy the detective work of fixing the data pipe just as much as building the executive dashboard at the end of it."

**STAR Response (Evidence):**
*   **Situation:** In my current role, I've moved from just "reporting" to "owning the process"—for example, automating the Personal Payment Audit.
*   **Task:** The TPA role requires someone to own "downstream data flow" and resolve issues, not just report them.
*   **Action:** This interests me because it combines **technical skill** (SQL/Power BI) with **operational ownership**.
*   **Result:** It aligns perfectly with my trajectory of taking over complex ticket workflows and driving data quality improvements (like reducing outstanding transaction days from 65 to 19).

---

## 2. Collaborate Together
*Evaluates: Building trust, influencing alignment, embracing diversity.*

### Q: Tell me about a time you succeeded in a project / initiative by collaborating with others.
**Story: Accountable Plan Rollout (2025)**
*   **Situation:** We needed to roll out changes to the "Accountable Plan," which required coordination across HR, Treasury, and offshore teams.
*   **Task:** My goal was to update the Terminated Power BI dashboard and create a new process to review outstanding transactions for employees on leave > 30 days.
*   **Action:** I collaborated with HR data partners to source new data fields. I worked with the offshore team to transition the daily monitoring tasks. I suggested a policy change to "suspend cards for employees on leave > 30 days" to reduce fraud risk.
*   **Result:** The rollout was successful with **no downstream impacts** despite a tight timeline. The new process I suggested is now standard policy, significantly reducing financial risk.

### Q: Describe a time when you did not achieve your individual goals because you did not to ask for help from others.
**Story: Payroll Report Error (2025)**
*   **Situation:** I was developing a new payroll report to capture newly taxable expense reimbursements. It was a high-stakes report affecting employee pay.
*   **Task:** I needed to ensure 100% accuracy before the payroll cycle deadline.
*   **Action:** I performed extensive testing myself but didn't ask for a peer review on the final data set before sending. There was a blind spot in my validation logic.
*   **Result:** The report contained errors that caused incorrect taxation for a subset of employees. I immediately simplified the "Action" steps to remediation, but I realized I should have asked for a "new pair of eyes" (collaboration) earlier. I’ve since implemented a pre-send peer review protocol.

## 3. Develop & Grow
*Evaluates: Self-development, seeking feedback, building technical capability.*

### Q: Describe actions you took that contributed to your personal or professional development.
**Story: AI & Python Upskilling (2023-2025)**
*   **Situation:** I realized that manual auditing of "TAD" (Travel and Expense) data was inefficient and I was hitting a ceiling with Excel.
*   **Task:** I wanted to use advanced AI/ML techniques to automate this validation.
*   **Action:** I proactively took courses in **Python Programming** and **AI tools**. I didn't just learn the theory; I applied it to the **TAD Audit**, using AI to scan and categorize transactions.
*   **Result:** I successfully completed the audit using these new tools. My manager noted in my 2025 review that I am "actively experimenting with AI tools to improve daily work," which has made me a go-to resource for technical innovation in the team.

### Q: Tell me about a time when you identified an area of improvement and proactively sought out opportunities to develop it.
**Story: Power BI & UI/UX Design (2025)**
*   **Situation:** Our reports were functional but hard for non-technical stakeholders to interpret quickly.
*   **Task:** I wanted to make our Power BI dashboards more intuitive and "executive-ready."
*   **Action:** I invested time in learning **UI/UX design principles** specifically for Power BI. I applied this to the **Corporate Credit Card KPI dashboard** and the **Unclaimed Property Filing dashboard**.
*   **Result:** Peers and managers praised the new clarity. It improved the "customer experience" of our internal reports, making data easier to consume for decision-making.

### Q: Tell me about a time you received negative feedback on an aspect of your work.
**Story: Deadline Consistency (2025)**
*   **Situation:** In 2025, I took on multiple large audits (Personal Payment, TAD, etc.) simultaneously.
*   **Task:** My manager gave feedback that while the *quality* was high, I occasionally missed deadlines on lower-priority operational tasks.
*   **Action:** I accepted the feedback without being defensive. I realized I was prioritizing "perfecting" the analysis over "shipping" the operational task.
*   **Result:** I adjusted my workflow to use a stricter prioritization matrix. I improved my SLA rate to **94%** on tickets and ensured that even if a deep-dive analysis took longer, the daily "keep the lights on" tasks were never dropped.

## 4. Puts Customers First
*Evaluates: Championing customer focus, anticipating needs.*

### Q: Tell me about a time when you have taken action to ensure that you are providing the best possible service to customers?
**Story: Reducing Days Outstanding (2025)**
*   **Situation:** Our internal customers (employees and the business) were struggling with a backlog of outstanding expenses, leading to late fees and friction. Average days outstanding was 65 days.
*   **Task:** I needed to improve the "customer experience" of the expense program by fixing the process, not just answering emails.
*   **Action:** I implemented the **Outstanding Transactions Audit**. I analyzed the root causes of delays and automated reminders/escalations.
*   **Result:** We reduced the average days outstanding from **65 days down to 19 days**. This vastly improved the experience for cardholders and reduced financial liability for the company.

### Q: Tell me about a time when you obtained up-to-date information related to customers about the external environment...
**Story: Identifying Fraud Risks (Accountable Plan) (2025)**
*   **Situation:** I monitored the external risk environment regarding employee leaves and corporate card usage.
*   **Task:** I realized that employees on long-term leave (external factor/HR status) were a vulnerability for credit card fraud.
*   **Action:** I used this information to propose a new policy: automatically suspending cards for employees on leave for > 30 days.
*   **Result:** This stopped a potential leak of funds before it happened. It was a proactive customer protection measure that balanced security with usability.

### Q: Tell me about a time when you found a customer problem especially difficult to deal with.
**Story: Diverse Stakeholder Needs (TSD Tickets)**
*   **Situation:** I took over the "Misc TSD Tickets" queue, which is a catch-all for the most confusing, non-standard customer problems.
*   **Task:** Customers were often frustrated because their issues didn't fit into a standard "box."
*   **Action:** Instead of just bouncing them to other departments, I took the time to learn the workflows for these edge cases. I maintained a **5-star customer satisfaction rating** even while learning these new complex areas.
*   **Result:** I turned "difficult" tickets into process improvements, identifying gaps in our SOPs that caused these customers to get stuck in the first place.

## 5. Fuel Innovation
*Evaluates: Creative thinking, seizing opportunities, learning from failure.*

### Q: Tell me about a situation in which you were required to come up with a creative idea or approach.
**Story: Digitization of ERS Receipts (2025)**
*   **Situation:** The team was spending hundreds of hours manually processing ERS (Evaluated Receipt Settlement) documentation.
*   **Task:** We needed to free up capacity.
*   **Action:** I helped implement the **digitization of ERS receipts**. I didn't just digitize the paper; I redesigned the workflow to be compatible with an offshore team's capabilities.
*   **Result:** This saved the team **over 93 hours** of manual work and recovered an additional **$1,700** in funds. It was a creative use of process redesign to create value.

### Q: Tell me about a situation which demonstrates your ability to solve a problem in a creative manner.
**Story: Automated Personal Payment Reconciliation (2024)**
*   **Situation:** Personal payments on corporate cards were a mess—manual tracking, emails, spreadsheet hell.
*   **Task:** I wanted to stop chasing employees and start automating the clean-up.
*   **Action:** I built a **Power Automate flow** intertwined with Power BI. It automatically identified personal spend, matched it against repayments, and flagged variances.
*   **Result:** The project was projected to save **25 hours per year** of pure manual data entry and improved the "Compliant Spend" metric to **97%**.

### Q: Describe a situation where you found it challenging to implement an innovative solution which required the input of others.
**Story: Unclaimed Property Dashboard (2025)**
*   **Situation:** I was tasked with building a dashboard for Unclaimed Property filings. The challenge was that the "requirements" were vague and the data owners weren't sure what they wanted.
*   **Task:** I had to innovate a visualization solution that would *show* them what was possible, rather than waiting for specs.
*   **Action:** I led **weekly working sessions** (collaborative innovation). I built an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) quickly to get feedback, rather than aiming for perfection.
*   **Result:** I delivered a dashboard that visualized counts and amounts clearly. It required "pushing" the stakeholders to define their needs by showing them the data first.

---

## 6. Provide Clear Direction
*Evaluates: Setting clear goals, keeping others informed, aligning to strategy.*

### Q: Describe a time when it has been important for you to identity and set yourself challenging and personal business goals...
**Story: T&E Card Adoption Goals (2025)**
*   **Situation:** The goal for "Card Adoption" is usually a flat target. I wanted to push it higher to drive maximizing rebate revenue.
*   **Task:** I set a personal target to exceed the standard adoption metrics.
*   **Action:** I didn't just monitor the number; I audited the *reasons* for non-adoption. I worked with the intern to analyze cash spend and found that our "new hire process" was the bottleneck.
*   **Result:** We achieved **96.3% adoption** (well above the 93% goal). I linked my personal goal (metrics) to a strategic business fix (new hire process).

### Q: Tell me about a time you motivated a colleague who felt detached from the larger organization.
**Story: Mentoring the Summer Intern (2023 & 2025)**
*   **Situation:** Interns often feel like they are just doing "busy work" and don't see the big picture.
*   **Task:** I wanted my intern to see how their "Cash Audit" work connected to the company's bottom line.
*   **Action:** I didn't just assign tasks; I explained the **strategic value** of the cash audit (adoption = rebates = revenue). I involved them in high-level Power BI calls so they could see the "Core" teams in action.
*   **Result:** The intern suggested a change to the new hire process—a strategic contribution. They felt empowered and connected, not just like a temporary helper.

### Q: Describe a time when your work goals were impacted by a colleague or team member who was not meeting expectations.
**Story: Transitioning Work to Offshore (EXL) Team (2025)**
*   **Situation:** I was transitioning tasks to our EXL (offshore) partners to free up capacity. The initial quality from the partner wasn't meeting our SOP standards.
*   **Task:** I needed to ensure the work got done without doing it myself, or the "efficiency" gains would be lost.
*   **Action:** I took a "coach, don't rescue" approach. I pushed back on quality issues, provided detailed feedback on the SOPs, and held "challenging conversations" to ensure they understood the standard.
*   **Result:** The partner eventually met the quality standards, allowing me to fully offload the work. My manager noted I am "great at pushing the team to ensure we have productive conversations."

## 7. Make it Happen
*Evaluates: Acting decisively in ambiguity, accountability, execution.*

### Q: Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision and the information available was inadequate.
**Story: MyExpense Mobile App Initiative (2025)**
*   **Situation:** I was assigned to the "myExpense mobile app" initiative. It was "just beginning," requirements were ambiguous, and we needed to get through a RAIC (Risk & Compliance) review.
*   **Task:** I had to manage the project aggressively to ensure a successful rollout by year-end despite the lack of clear documentation.
*   **Action:** I didn't wait for a playbook. I dove into the **AI technology** supporting the app to understand its limits myself. I made risk assumptions based on my experience with the Accountable Plan to keep the project moving.
*   **Result:** The project is on track. I demonstrated that I can drive a "Year-End" critical deliverable even when the path isn't fully paved.

### Q: Please give me an example that demonstrates your approach to monitoring the progress of team members and holding them accountable.
**Story: Outstanding Transactions Audit (2025)**
*   **Situation:** Reducing days outstanding required holding hundreds of individual employees accountable for their expense reports.
*   **Task:** I couldn't email 500 people individually.
*   **Action:** I built a **systematic monitoring process** (Audit). I set up clear "rules of engagement"—if you are > 60 days, you get X notification. If > 90, card suspension.
*   **Result:** The data (19 days avg outstanding) proves the accountability worked. It wasn't personal; it was process-driven accountability.

### Q: Tell me about a time you were unable to follow through on a commitment.
**Story: Personal Payment Audit Deadline (2025)**
*   **Situation:** I committed to completing the Personal Payment Audit by the end of Q1.
*   **Task:** I was balancing this with the unexpected "Payroll Report" remediation work.
*   **Action:** I missed the original deadline.
*   **Result:** I didn't hide it. I communicated the status to my manager. While the deadline was missed, I ensured the **high-risk** transactions were reviewed first (prioritization). I learned that I need to build more "buffer" into my project plans for ad-hoc operational fires.

## 💡 Technical Competency Prep
*William may ask you to "Define the functional skill" for these areas:*

**1. Data Lineage & Governance**
*   **The Insight:** In TPA operations, "mystery numbers" are the silent killer of trust—where the end report differs from the source with no clear audit trail.
*   **Operational Reality:** From my experience, the only way to guarantee trust is **Data Lineage** transparency. We must be able to answer "Where did this number come from (Source)?", "How was it transformed (Logic)?", and "Where does it end up (Report)?" immediately. If we can't search the lineage, we can't trust the metric.
*   **Relevance:** I am prepared to apply this rigorous lineage approach (using Power BI/SQL) to ensure your stakeholders never have to guess if the data is accurate.

**2. Performance Analytics (vs. Just "Reporting")**
*   **The Insight:** There is a critical difference between "Data Retrieval" and true "Business Intelligence."
*   **Operational Reality:** Standard reporting just tells you *what* happened (e.g., total claims). But **Performance Analytics**—which is what this role demands—tells you *why* it happened and *what to do next*. It overlays context (benchmarks, trends, outliers) to turn raw rows of data into a decision framework.
*   **Relevance:** My approach isn't just to deliver a spreadsheet; it's to deliver a decision-making tool that highlights the "So What?" for leadership.

## ❓ Strategic Questions for William
1.  **The "Future State" Question:**
    "William, fast-forwarding 12 months: if I've been wildly successful in this role, what is the *one* thing about your data governance or Claims Mart flow that works differently than it does today?"

2.  **The "Strategic Scrutiny" Question:**
    "The JD mentions ensuring initiatives are subject to 'systematic financial scrutiny.' Is the current challenge that you don't have the framework defined, or that it's defined but people aren't following it?"

3.  **The "Ops vs. Analytics" Question:**
    "How does your team currently balance the daily 'factory work' of production reporting with the 'lab work' of deep-dive analytics? Where do you want to shift that balance?"
