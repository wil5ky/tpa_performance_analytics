# Interview Preparation Plan: William Schwartz (Hiring Manager)

## Goal
To prepare William Namayi for his interview with William Schwartz (Hiring Manager) in 48 hours by leveraging his resume, the job description, and the provided "Interview Prep Framework".

## Strategic Positioning
**Role:** TPA Operations Sr. Performance Analyst
**Audience:** Hiring Manager (William Schwartz) - likely focused on execution, team fit, and ability to "hit the ground running" with data governance and strategic initiatives.

**Key Themes to Hit:**
1.  **Ownership:** You don't just "report" numbers; you own the quality, the flow, and the governance.
2.  **Scalability:** You build systems (dashboards, frameworks) that scale, not just ad-hoc analysis.
3.  **Bridge Builder:** You connect technical data work (SQL/Python) with business decisions (Strategic Goals).

## Competency Mapping (Framework vs. Resume/Stories)

We will use your existing "STAR Story Bank" from the screening prep and map them to William Schwartz's 5 Core Competencies.

### 1. Collaborate Together
*   **Prompt:** "Tell me about a time you succeeded in a project by collaborating with others."
*   **Best Story:** **STAR #4 (Cross-functional strategic initiative execution)**
    *   *Why:* Shows you working with Security, Legal, Audit, and Vendors.
    *   *Adaptation:* Emphasize *how* you built trust and alignment across these diverse groups.

### 2. Develop & Grow
*   **Prompt:** "Describe actions you took that contributed to your personal or professional development."
*   **Best Story:** **STAR #7 (AI-enabled forensic validation) or Resume "Mentorship"**
    *   *Why:* Shows you proactively learning Python/AI to solve a hard problem (Forensic Validation).
    *   *Adaptation:* Focus on the *learning process*—how you identified that manual validation was unsustainable and taught yourself a new method (AI/Python) to solve it.

### 3. Puts Customers First
*   **Prompt:** "Tell me about a time when you have taken action to ensure that you are providing the best possible service to customers?"
*   **Best Story:** **STAR #3 (Governance framework)** or **STAR #1 (Downstream data quality)**
    *   *Why:* Your "customers" are internal leadership and stakeholders who need accurate data to make decisions.
    *   *Adaptation:* Frame the "Stakeholders/Leadership" as your customer. "My customer was the leadership team who needed to trust the numbers..."

### 4. Fuel Innovation
*   **Prompt:** "Tell me about a situation in which you were required to come up with a creative idea or approach."
*   **Best Story:** **STAR #7 (AI-enabled forensic validation)** or **STAR #8 (AI + workflow visualization)**
    *   *Why:* This is your strongest innovation differentiator. Using AI agents + SQL validation is cutting edge.
    *   *Adaptation:* Emphasize the "creative" part—combining AI with strict governance controls.

### 5. Provide Clear Direction
*   **Prompt:** "Describe a time when it has been important for you to identify and set yourself challenging and personal business goals..."
*   **Best Story:** **STAR #3 (Governance framework)**
    *   *Why:* You set the goal to create a governance framework where none existed.
    *   *Adaptation:* Focus on *setting the goal*—"I realized we lacked systematic scrutiny, so I made it my goal to build a framework..."

### 6. Make it Happen
*   **Prompt:** "Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision and the information available was inadequate."
*   **Best Story:** **STAR #8 (Workflow visualization/Standardization)** or **STAR #1 (Data Quality)**
    *   *Why:* Dealing with "inadequate information" (bad data/ambiguity).
    *   *Adaptation:* "When data was inconsistent, I didn't just guess. I built a process to flag issues..."

## Technical Competency Prep
The framework asks for "Technical Competency 1 / 2".
**Focus Areas:**
1.  **Data -> Insight Journey:** Be ready to whiteboard (verbally or strictly) how you take raw data (SQL) -> transformation (Power Query/Python) -> Visual (Power BI) -> Insight (Governance).
2.  **Claims Mart / Data Warehousing:** Review basic concepts of Claims Data Marts (Fact tables vs Dimension tables) just in case.
3.  **Governance Controls:** Be ready to discuss *how* you validate data (SQL tie-outs, checksums).

## Strategic Questions for William Schwartz
1.  **The "Success" Question:** "Fast forwarding 12 months, if I've been wildly successful in this role, what is the *one* thing related to the 'Claims Mart' or data governance that works differently than it does today?" (Shows you are results-oriented).
2.  **The "Strategy" Question:** "The JD mentions leading strategic initiatives. Could you give an example of a current initiative that is 'data-starved' or needs better financial scrutiny right now?" (Shows you want to solve real problems).
3.  **The "Team" Question:** "How does your team currently balance the 'factory' work of regular reporting with the 'lab' work of deep-dive analytics and innovation? Where do you want to shift that balance?" (Shows you think about operational cadence).

## Proposed "Next Steps"
1.  **Draft Full Narrative:** I will generate a full `Interview_Prep_William_Schwartz.md` document with these mapped stories fully written out.
2.  **Mock Q&A:** I can simulate William Schwartz asking these questions if you like.
