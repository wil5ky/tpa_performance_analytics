Subject: Thank You - TPA Operations Sr. Performance Analyst Discussion

Hi William,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me yesterday. I really appreciated learning about your management philosophy—particularly your emphasis on accountability paired with autonomy. That approach resonates strongly with how I work best and aligns perfectly with my experience driving independent analytics initiatives at Liberty Mutual.

Our conversation reinforced my excitement about this role. The opportunity to double down on my skill set in performance analytics and data governance while contributing to TPA's strategic objectives is exactly the kind of challenge I'm looking for.

I've put together an interactive dashboard that demonstrates my approach to data storytelling. While it wasn't requested, I wanted to share a tangible example of how I translate complex data into actionable insights and compelling narratives. The dashboard showcases TPA portfolio analytics with a focus on performance metrics, benefit realization, and data governance—areas we discussed as critical to the role.

I'm genuinely enthusiastic about the possibility of bringing this analytical mindset and storytelling capability to your team. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's additional information I can provide.

Looking forward to next steps!

Best regards,
William Namayi
