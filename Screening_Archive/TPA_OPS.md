# Zurich – TPA Operations Sr. Performance Analyst (25-min Recruiter Screen Prep)
Date: 2025-12-22

## 1) Role target (what the recruiter is screening for)
From the JD, this role is looking for someone who can:
- Turn complex datasets into actionable insights (trends → recommendations)
- Own the downstream flow of TPA data through “Claims Mart” (data quality, data flow issue resolution, understanding impacts)
- Lead/own reporting: profitability reports, performance monitoring by product/LOB, deeper insight initiatives
- Be the first point of contact for strategic initiatives (messaging, reports, projections, governance)
- Communicate clearly with stakeholders; manage consultancies when needed

Your strongest “instant fit” themes from your resume:
- 6+ years analytics/finance in insurance + regulated finance (Liberty Mutual + Apex/FINRA)
- First point of contact for strategic initiatives + governance framework development
- Data quality + downstream data flow ownership (reduced errors 83%; built validation/monitoring)
- Automation + reporting at scale (360+ hours saved; 15+ dashboards; 20,000+ user program monitoring)
- Recognized for high-impact reporting (dashboard work that helped uncover close to $110M in unclaimed property to be filed)
- Strong tool match: SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel; enterprise systems (SAP, Emburse)


## 2) Your positioning (say this early)
### 30-second pitch (tight)
"I'm a Senior Treasury Analyst at Liberty Mutual, but my work is really performance analytics and governance. I've spent about 6 years turning operational and financial data into insights that executives can actually use. I'm the go-to person for strategic initiatives, and I manage data flows and quality—I've built automated monitoring and validation that cut errors by 83% and freed up about 360 hours a year. I also use AI in a controlled way to speed things up—it helps me spot patterns and triage issues faster, but I always validate everything through SQL checks and tie-outs before anything goes out. What really drew me to this Zurich role is it sits right at that sweet spot of performance reporting, data governance, and solving those data flow problems that can derail decisions."

### 2-minute pitch (when they say “walk me through your background”)
- “I started in fintech/clearing where I built and monitored large financial models ($8–10B across 70+ accounts) and worked in a regulated environment (SEC/FINRA). That trained me to be precise about controls, governance, and how reporting decisions impact the business.”
- “At Liberty Mutual, I moved deeper into enterprise operations analytics and governance. I provide advanced analysis on strategic initiatives and built a governance framework so initiatives get systematic financial scrutiny.”
- “On the technical side, I regularly use SQL, Python, Power BI (including DAX/semantic models), and Python to build monitoring suites and automated validation. That includes managing data movement across systems, catching issues early, and producing dashboards leaders actually use.”
- “This Zurich role is a direct match: performance trends, profitability reporting, data quality, and being the connective tissue between data, operations, and leadership decisions.”


## 3) 25-minute recruiter screen (recommended flow)
Use this to keep the conversation structured.

### Minute 0–2: Open strong
- Confirm role/title and recruiter’s goals: “Before I jump in, are you mainly validating fit + logistics today?”
- Deliver the 30-second pitch.

### Minute 2–10: Fit highlights (3 bullets only)
Pick 3 and stop.
1) Data governance + quality: reduced errors 83% (118 → 20) via automated validation frameworks in Power BI.
2) Automation + scale: saved 360+ hours/year with SQL + ETL + automated monitoring; built 15+ dashboards.
3) Strategic initiative leadership: governance framework + cross-functional execution; first point of contact; vendor/consultancy coordination.

Optional AI one-liner (use only if they ask about AI or if the recruiter seems excited about it):
“I use AI to accelerate the front half of the work—triage, pattern-finding, and drafting—and then I rely on governed validation to ensure data quality before anything goes to leadership.”

### Minute 10–18: 2 STAR stories (pick 2)
Choose stories that mirror the JD: data flow issue resolution + profitability/performance reporting + governance.

### Minute 18–22: Logistics (recruiter questions)
Be ready for:
- Why Zurich / why this role
- Location/hybrid
- Compensation expectations
- Work authorization
- Start date

### Minute 22–25: Your questions + close
Ask 3–4 high-signal questions (see section 6) and close with a clear ask:
“I’m very interested. Based on what we discussed, do you see any concerns about my fit for the role? If not, I’d love to move to the next step.”


## 4) STAR story bank (pick 5–6; memorize 2)
Keep each story to ~60–90 seconds.

### STAR #1 — Downstream data quality + error reduction (most on-target)
- Situation: Operational reporting depended on data flowing correctly across enterprise systems.
- Task: Improve data quality and reduce recurring errors that affected reporting/decisions.
- Actions: Built automated validation frameworks and monitoring in Power BI; focused on integrity checks, issue triage, and faster root-cause identification (including AI-assisted summarization of error patterns when helpful).
- Result: Reduced data errors by 83% (118 → 20). Improved confidence in reporting.

Optional one-liner tie-back (if they ask about “Claims Mart”):
"My current setup isn't called Claims Mart, but it's really the same challenge—when downstream operational data doesn't land correctly, everything breaks down for reporting and decisions. So I've built monitoring and validation with a repeatable process for catching and fixing issues."

### STAR #2 — Automation + time savings (efficiency + scale)
- Situation: Manual reconciliation and recurring reporting tasks consumed analyst time.
- Task: Reduce manual work while improving accuracy.
- Actions: Built SQL + complex ETL operational data infrastructure; automated reconciliations and refresh monitoring; used AI to speed up documentation and accelerate analysis drafts while keeping calculations and validation deterministic.
- Result: Saved 360+ hours annually; improved data accuracy and speed-to-insight.

### STAR #3 — Governance framework for systematic scrutiny (matches JD “governance framework”)
- Situation: Leadership needed consistent rigor across initiatives.
- Task: Create a framework that ensures high-quality, systematic financial scrutiny.
- Actions: Developed enterprise governance framework; created dashboard suite for performance trend monitoring; partnered across Audit/Transformation/Procurement; applied an “AI-with-controls” approach where AI accelerates early analysis but decisions are based on validated numbers and documented assumptions.
- Result: Enabled identifying underperforming areas and driving improvements (3+ major improvements annually; 70% YoY efficiency gain noted on resume).

Optional add-on proof point (use if you need more credibility fast):
"I should mention that some of my dashboard work actually helped uncover close to $110 million in unclaimed property that needed to be filed."

### STAR #4 — Cross-functional strategic initiative execution (stakeholders + consultancies)
- Situation: Strategic initiative requiring alignment across Security, Legal, Audit, IT, and vendors.
- Task: Drive approvals, deliverables, and timelines.
- Actions: Managed multi-committee approval workflows; coordinated vendors/consultancies; communicated progress and risks.
- Result: Delivered enterprise migration/implementation work (example: mobile app migration for 20,000+ users; 95% operational readiness).

### STAR #5 — Compliance monitoring at scale (good for “insurance + controls”)
- Situation: Need to monitor adherence and detect risk patterns.
- Task: Build monitoring and support proactive risk management.
- Actions: Built monitoring frameworks tracking compliant spend (95.9%) and adoption (96.3%) across 20,000+ users; explored anomaly detection in Python with Internal Audit.
- Result: Stronger control environment + earlier risk detection.

### STAR #6 — Regulated environment rigor (FINRA/SEC)
- Situation: Treasury models and reporting required strict compliance controls.
- Task: Ensure accurate forecasting and compliance monitoring.
- Actions: Built compliance monitoring; partnered with regulatory reporting; performed systematic scrutiny.
- Result: Supported SEC/FINRA requirements and customer asset protection while forecasting NII and performance.

### STAR #7 — AI-enabled forensic validation (your key differentiator; maps to “data quality + impacts”)
- Situation: Broker packages and source documents can contain inconsistencies and optimistic assumptions; if you accept them at face value, you can make materially wrong decisions.
- Task: Build a repeatable, high-integrity analysis workflow that verifies inputs, flags issues with quantified impact, and produces decision-ready reporting.
- Actions:
	- Built an AI-assisted, multi-agent workflow to extract information, cross-check it against source documents, and run a structured “forensic validation” process.
	- Implemented a financial calculator in Python (IRR/NPV/DSCR) and stored analysis artifacts in a normalized SQLite database (19 tables) so outputs were traceable and repeatable.
	- Created a validation methodology (“Solarium Method”) that reconciles income/expense line-by-line and forces independent market verification (30+ sources).
- Result: Prevented $5.7M in potential investment losses by identifying 12–17% overvaluation and hidden cost risks; reduced analysis cycle time from 4–6 hours to <5 minutes while improving documentation consistency (305+ pages produced).

How to translate this to Zurich/TPA (one line):
"It's the same skill set that TPA governance needs—you can't just report the numbers. You've got to validate the assumptions coming in, understand what the downstream impact is, and build a workflow you can repeat so people can actually trust what you're giving them."

### STAR #8 — AI + workflow visualization + governance (maps to “visual workflows” + “governance framework”)
- Situation: Complex analysis work breaks down when steps aren’t standardized—different analysts get different answers, and stakeholders can’t see where numbers came from.
- Task: Create a governed workflow that makes analysis steps transparent, auditable, and easy to execute repeatedly.
- Actions:
	- Designed an end-to-end workflow from sourcing → validation → analysis → reporting, with clear handoffs between specialized AI agents and deterministic calculation steps.
	- Produced standardized templates and documentation (5 templates; 305+ pages) so outputs were consistent and stakeholders could follow the logic.
	- Built “stop/continue” gates (quality scoring / validation checkpoints) to prevent bad inputs from flowing downstream.
- Result: Delivered institutional-grade, repeatable analyses with fast turnaround and higher confidence in decisions; standardized reporting reduced documentation time 60%+.


## 4A) Quick AI talking track (use if recruiter asks about AI)
Keep this to ~20–30 seconds.
- "I think of AI as something that speeds me up, not something I just trust blindly. I split the work—AI helps with pulling information and finding patterns, then I validate everything with SQL and Python checks, reconciliations, and source document tie-outs."
- "I'm pretty strict about keeping track of where numbers come from—what source, what checks passed or failed, what changed along the way. That's how you keep data quality intact and avoid problems downstream."
- "For something like TPA work at Zurich, AI would be really useful for sorting through data flow issues, summarizing what's weird, and speeding up the investigation. But you'd still need the governance and validation piece to make sure the accuracy is there."


## 4B) AI phrasing to weave into any answer (pick 1)
- "AI helps me move faster, but I always make sure the output is validated—checked numbers, documented assumptions, full traceability."
- "AI helps me ask better questions earlier in the process, but SQL, Python, and the control checks give me the actual answer."


## 5) Recruiter FAQ answers (say it like this)
### “Why are you looking / why leave?”
"I really like my current team, but I'm looking for a role that's more directly focused on performance analytics and governance in claims operations—where I'm owning data quality and producing insights that actually influence leadership decisions. This Zurich role is exactly what I'm looking for."

### “Why Zurich?”
“Zurich is a major P&C carrier with scale, and the role is very clearly positioned at the intersection of data governance, performance reporting, and strategic decision support. That’s where I’ve been strongest—building monitoring suites, improving data quality, and translating trends into recommendations.”

### “Why this TPA role specifically?”
"I've really done the two hardest parts of what's in this job description—owning downstream data quality and fixing data flow issues, then turning all of that into reporting and governance that stakeholders can actually use. I want to take those skills and apply them in a claims context where I'm focused on TPA performance and profitability."

### “What’s your strongest skill set for this?”
"Taking data all the way through to decisions—SQL, Power BI, governance, and being able to communicate it to executives. I'm comfortable being the point person who validates the data and produces analysis that leaders can actually act on."

### “What are you working on now?”
"Right now I'm doing enterprise monitoring and governance for treasury operational programs—managing data flows, doing audits, compliance monitoring, building dashboards that track performance trends and help drive process improvements."

### “What tools do you use?”
"Power BI—including the modeling side and DAX—SQL for ETL work and analysis, Python for automation and exploring anomaly detection, Excel for modeling, and then enterprise systems like SAP and Emburse."

### “Work authorization?”
JD says sponsorship not offered. Be ready to answer your exact situation clearly.


## 6) Questions to ask the recruiter (pick 4)
These are intentionally recruiter-answerable.
Transition line (say this first):
"If it's okay, I've got a few quick questions about process and logistics so I can make sure my expectations are aligned."
1) “What are the next steps and interview stages for this role?”
2) “What’s the hiring timeline and target start date?”
3) “How is this role leveled (associate/senior/etc.), and what profiles map best to that level?”
4) “Can you share the budgeted compensation range for my location and how the 15% bonus is typically applied?”
5) “Where is the hiring manager and team primarily located, and which office would you expect me to align to from Addison?”
6) “What does ‘hybrid’ mean operationally—typical in-office cadence and any travel expectations?”
7) “What are the top skills/experiences you’re screening for most heavily in the first interview?” Aswer: Experience with TPA, insurance, claims ops etc.
8) “Are there any must-have requirements I should know about up front (background check timing, 18 U.S. Code §1033, references)?”


## 7) Compensation + logistics (recruiter-safe wording)
The JD lists: $85,500 – $140,000 base + 15% bonus eligibility.

### If they ask “What are you targeting?”
Option A (anchored but flexible):
"Based on the scope and what I bring, I'm looking at the upper half of the range you posted, but I'm flexible depending on the total package and how the role is leveled. What's been budgeted for this position in my location?"

Option B (if you want to avoid a number):
"Honestly, I'm most focused on the fit and how the role is leveled. Since the range is already posted, I'd be curious to hear where you see me landing based on my background."

### Hybrid/location
"I'm based in Addison, Texas. I'm totally comfortable with a hybrid schedule and coming in as needed, and I can work with whatever cadence the team has at the Zurich office I'd be assigned to. If the role is mainly out of Schaumburg but there are other office options, I'm happy to talk through what makes the most sense."

If they ask "Are you local to Schaumburg / will you relocate?"
"I'm in Addison right now. I'm open to whatever works for the role's office setup—whether that's connecting to a different Zurich location or having a conversation about relocation—depending on how things are leveled and what the typical schedule looks like."

### Start date
If true for you: "I'd need to give standard notice, but I can nail down an exact date once we're further along."


## 8) Quick reminders (what recruiters reward)
- Be crisp: 1–2 sentences per answer, then stop.
- Always include a metric when possible (83% error reduction; 360+ hours saved; 15+ dashboards; 20,000+ users).
- Tie everything back to claims/TPA: “data quality,” “performance reporting,” “governance,” “stakeholder messaging.”


## 9) Your closing line (use verbatim)
"I'm confident I can bring what you need here—strong governance, data quality ownership, and performance reporting that gives Zurich more reliable TPA insights and faster decision-making. I'm really excited about this opportunity. What would the next steps look like?"
