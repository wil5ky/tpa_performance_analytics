### Performance Impact Category: **Positive**

### Peer Feedback (AI Summarized)

You are a valued Treasury resource with strong Power BI and AI skills who runs helpful BI sessions and prepares well-researched materials. To increase your impact, respond more promptly to email and Teams, take more ownership of ERS/miscellaneous tickets and day-to-day workflows, and more often suggest next steps in meetings so work doesn't stall. Simple habits like quick acknowledgements and volunteering follow-up actions will help turn your technical strengths and teaching into greater operational impact.

### Growth

This year, you made notable contributions to others' growth, building on your mentoring and training skill set. Much of this work involved sharing Power BI knowledge and driving related process improvements. Peers praised your approach, highlighting your approachability and ability to break down complex concepts. Similarly, your mentorship of our summer intern received positive feedback. You also invested time in enhancing your UI/UX skills to improve Power BI reporting visuals. Outside of Treasury, you attended multiple networking events to expand your network and learn about others' roles and DE&I initiatives. Great job continuing to invest in yourself!

### Goals Feedback

#### #1: Operational Excellence

**Operational Process Completion:** All assigned operational tasks are completed. Will has taken over the Misc. TSD tickets this year to free up time for Leigha to train our new hire, currently his SLA rate is 94% with a customer satisfaction rate of a 5. While this is lower than the 97% goal, Will is learning in this space and there are a lot of various workflows within this ticket to master. SLA%s trended upwards as time went on. There are some examples that show Will has opportunity to follow-up timelier with customers and prevent follow-ups from coming to him from others. While all other assigned tasks are completed, some were submitted later than expected. The personal payment audit and TAD audit are examples of this. The more important tasks were prioritized correctly; however deadlines were missed on multiple occasions.

**T&E Card Program Management:** All targets for Card adoption and compliant spend percentages are strong at 96.3% and 95.91% YTD. Outstanding transactions have been reduced to less than 19 days, well surpassing the goals.

**Process Improvements:** Will helped implement the digitization of ERS receipts this quarter which as a team saved over 93 hours of time and allowed for us to collect an additional $1700 in funds back. Will transitioned multiple tasks to our EXL team to free up additional capacity from the onshore team. As we rolled out Accountable Plan changes a great suggestion was made and ultimately implemented to suspend cards for employee on leave for more than 30 days, reducing the risk of fraud. Will continues to update and modernize dashboards within Payment Services including the Corporate Credit Card KPI dashboard and Reconciliation Model. Outside of Payment Services Will contributed towards the development of the Unclaimed Property Filing Power BI Dashboard.

**Vendor and Team Relationships:** Relationships with key partners such as US Bank and the offshore team are well maintained. Will is great at having challenging conversations and pushing the team and key stakeholders to ensure we are having productive conversations.

**Documentation and Knowledge Management:** This continues to be an area of opportunity, especially as automation is created/used and processes change.

**Assigned Reporting Projects:**
- **Personal Payment Audit - End of Q1:** Work continues on this to improve how it's done and to ensure we are focused on the highest risk transactions.
- **Outstanding Transactions Audit - End of Q2:** Implemented and in production. This had a direct impact on the teams ability to reduce our days outstanding average from 65 to 19.
- **Cash Audit - End of Q3:** Supported our intern through the summer to audit our cash spend; ultimately a change to our new hire process was suggested and in process of being implemented to improve overall card adoption.
- **Compliance Audit - End of Q4:** Currently partnering with Treasury D&A team to implement.
- **myExpense & Access Online Audit:** Requirements were created, a process developed, and audit was completed to ensure our NDAs were updated and in place for all users with access to confidential expense data/access.

#### #2: Talent Development

Great engagement is seen with our AI goals, with Will even doing additional training in his personal time. Will is actively experimenting with AI tools to find ways to improve his daily work. This technology was used quite extensively to complete the TAD Audit this year. Will continues to share his learnings and passion with the team as he finds helpful solutions, even having presented in our department with COE calls.

#### #3: Value Center

Testing for the myExpense UI and GL mapping changes was completed as requested although involvement was limited. The larger opportunity this year was Will's role in the Accountable Plan rollout. These changes required updates to the Terminated Power BI dashboard, coordination with HR data partners to source additional data, and the creation of a new process to review outstanding transactions/cards for employees on leave longer than 30 days. This work was completed and transitioned effectively to the offshore team; although slightly delayed from the original agreed upon date, there were no downstream impacts.

The second component involved developing a payroll report and process to capture newly taxable expense reimbursements. Extensive testing was completed with confidence however, the first report sent to payroll contained errors. Will immediately took ownership, performed a comprehensive analysis to identify all issues, and coordinated prompt remediation with payroll. However, the errors resulted in incorrect taxation for a subset of employees in that payroll cycle, causing pay and withholding impacts that required correction and caused several hours of re-work for our payroll partners. Learnings from this incident were used to strengthen controls, including enhanced data validation and pre-send review protocols, to prevent recurrence but this was preventable.

Will has also been newly assigned to the myExpense mobile app initiative. Although it is just beginning, it will require aggressive management through year-end to ensure a successful rollout and a higher degree of understanding of the AI technology being used to support it to get us through the RAIC review.

### Manager Summary

Will I appreciate your diverse perspective and willingness to learn and support all your Treasury peers not just those within your own team. Overall this year was good with some shining spots and also highlighted areas of opportunity for you. Consistency in meeting deadlines, reviews to ensure accuracy in your work, improved communication with your peers, working pro-actively, and finding ways to implement process improvements with measurable impact will help you elevate your impact. Continue investing in yourself and others, challenging the status quo, and bringing your authentic self to work. Thank you for your dedication to the team and Liberty.

### What You Accomplished

Will has played many roles this year starting the year supporting UAT testing and BAM implementation from a SAP perspective. Providing coverage for ERS, SA Cash, Liberty Accounts Payable functions and taking the lead on our team for some larger reporting asks.

He was our summer intern's mentor and has completed several training sessions with the team to develop Power BI skills.

The new TSD metrics that he created will be a huge impact in 2024 and he has started a health dashboard for our ERS functions that should drive change too!

### How You Accomplished It

Will is a true team player. We are grateful for his willingness to pivot and take on new tasks/roles for the Treasury organization. He is great at challenging the status quo and really listening to what others are saying to understand the situation. He is always willing to stop and assist the team with technical issues and seeks to transfer knowledge to make the team better every day. This year he has exceeding expectations in personal development as he has spent a significant time amount outside of work learning new skills that will benefit Treasury (Python and Power BI). His calm and positive demeanor and unique life perspective gives the team a fresh perspective when things get tough!

William quickly became a key contributor to the payment services team especially when it comes to data mining, learning and implementing new technologies, and supporting new system rollouts (SAP and Emburse Pro). His ability to dig into a complex issue that he has no background in is impressive and he is able to work very independently with minimal guidance.
